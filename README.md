# Jagriti Case Search API

A Flask-based service that provides an interface to search for cases in Indian Consumer Courts through the Jagriti portal.

## Features

- **7 Search Endpoints**: Search cases by case number, complainant, respondent, advocates, industry type, and judge
- **State & Commission Management**: Get available states and commissions with their internal IDs
- **Real-time Data**: Makes actual requests to the Jagriti portal (not mock data)
- **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented REST endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and logging
- **Web Scraping**: Automated scraping of Jagriti portal for real data

## API Endpoints

### Core Search Endpoints
- `POST /cases/by-case-number` - Search by case number
- `POST /cases/by-complainant` - Search by complainant name
- `POST /cases/by-respondent` - Search by respondent name
- `POST /cases/by-complainant-advocate` - Search by complainant advocate
- `POST /cases/by-respondent-advocate` - Search by respondent advocate
- `POST /cases/by-industry-type` - Search by industry type
- `POST /cases/by-judge` - Search by judge name

### Supporting Endpoints
- `GET /states` - Get all available states with IDs
- `GET /commissions/{state_id}` - Get commissions for a specific state

## Request Format

All search endpoints accept the following JSON payload:

    "commission": "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional",
    "search_value": "123/2025"
}
```

## Response Format

Search endpoints return an array of case objects:

```json
[
    {
        "case_number": "123/2025",
        "case_stage": "Hearing",
        "filing_date": "2025-02-01",
        "complainant": "John Doe",
        "complainant_advocate": "Adv. Reddy",
        "respondent": "XYZ Ltd.",
        "respondent_advocate": "Adv. Mehta",
        "document_link": "https://e-jagriti.gov.in/.../case123"
    }
]
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python3 enhanced_flask_app.py
   ```

3. **Test the API**
   ```bash
   python3 test_api.py
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage Examples

### Get Available States
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/states"
```

### Get Commissions for a State
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/commissions/1"
```

### Search Cases by Case Number
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cases/by-case-number" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "state": "KARNATAKA",
    "commission": "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional",
    "search_value": "123/2025"
  }'
```

### Search Cases by Complainant
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cases/by-complainant" \

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flask (for Python 3.13 compatibility)
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **HTTP Client**: httpx (async)
- **HTML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup4
- **Web Scraping**: Custom scraper for Jagriti portal
- **CORS**: Enabled for cross-origin requests

## Web Scraping Features

The API includes a comprehensive web scraper that:
- ✅ Extracts states and commissions from Jagriti portal
- ✅ Handles CSRF tokens and form submissions
- ✅ Parses search results from HTML tables
- ✅ Extracts case details and document links

- ✅ Error handling and logging

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid search parameters return 400 Bad Request
- Server errors return 500 Internal Server Error
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for scraping failures
- Mock data fallback when Jagriti portal is unavailable

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python3 test_api.py
```

This will test all endpoints and error cases.

## Notes
